#Java Methods UMSL Professor Lawton

As a beginner software developer, I had no prior experience in coding until these projects. Please note that much of my code could be enhanced, but it served its purpose in teaching me the basics. I have uploaded this code so that others may take a look and learn from it as well.

The methods project is my first project in Java, and functions as a virtual calculator. Please be advised it's extremely basic, but it taught me several aspects of Java.
